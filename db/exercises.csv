At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull.

<li> This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.</li>
<li> Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.</li>
<li> Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).</li>
<li> Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.</li>
<li> Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.</li>

<li>To set up the chains, begin by looping the leader chain over the sleeves of the bar. The heavy chain should be attached using a snap hook. Adjust the length of the lead chain so that a few links are still on the floor at the top of the movement.</li>
<li>  Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward, attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack, creating a tight arch in your lower back, and step back into position. Place your feet wide for more emphasis on the back, glutes, adductors, and hamstrings. Keep your head facing forward.</li>
<li> With your back, shoulders, and core tight, push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips as much as possible. Ideally, your shins should be perpendicular to the ground. Lower bar position necessitates a greater torso lean to keep the bar over the heels. Continue until you break parallel, which is defined as the crease of the hip being in line with the top of the knee. </li>
<li>Keeping the weight on your heels and pushing your feet and knees out, drive upward as you lead the movement with your head. Continue upward, maintaining tightness head to toe, until you have returned to the starting position.</li>

<li>With a barbell on boxes or stands of the desired height, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li> Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight with the elbows pointed out.</li> Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight. At the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.<li> As full extension is achieved, transition into the receiving position by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. Aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.  </li>

<li>This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes.  To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height.  Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor.  Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.</li>
<li>Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.</li> <li>Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (<strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).</li>
<li>Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  <strong>Tip:</strong> If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.</li>
<li>Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.</li>

Allow your arms to hang perpendicular to the floor, with the wrists pronated and the elbows pointed to your sides. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li> Initiate the movement by flexing your hips, slowly pushing your butt as far back as you can. This should entail a horizontal movement of the hips, rather than a downward movement. The knees should only partially bend, and your weight should remain on your heels.</li>
<li> Drive your butt back as far as you can, which should generate tension in your hamstrings as your hands approach knee level. Maintain an arch in your back throughout the exercise.</li>

<li>This trainer is effective for developing Atlas Stone strength for those who don't have access to stones, and are typically made from bar ends or heavy pipe.</li>
<li> Begin by loading the desired weight onto the bar. Straddle the weight, wrapping your arms around the implement, bending at the hips.</li>
<li> Begin by pulling the weight up past the knees, extending through the hips. As the weight clears the knees, it can be lapped by resting it on your thighs and sitting back, hugging it tightly to your chest. </li>
<li>Finish the movement by extending through your hips and knees to raise the weight as high as possible. The weight can be returned to the lap or to the ground for successive repetitions.</li>

<li>Set the bar up in a power rack. Attach bands to the top of the rack, using either bands pegs or the frame itself. Attach the other end of the bands to the bar.</li>
<li> Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width, allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets.</li>
<li> With your feet, and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head, keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward.</li>
<li> After the bar passes the knees, aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar.</li>
<li> Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.</li>

<li> Start by placing a barbell that is about chest high on a squat rack.  Once you have selected the weights, grab the barbell using a pronated (palms facing forward) grip.  Make sure to grip the bar wider than shoulder width apart from each other.</li>
<li> Slightly bend the knees and place the barbell on your collar bone.  Lift the barbell up keeping it lying on your chest.  Take a step back and position your feet shoulder width apart from each other.</li>
<li> Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms.  Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head.  This is your starting position.</li>
<li> Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale.</li>
<li> Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.</li>

<li>With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back  straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. </li>
<li> Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.</li>
<li> Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.</li>
<li> As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.  </li>
<li>Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. </li>
<li> The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.</li>
<li> Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.</li>
<li> At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position. </li>
